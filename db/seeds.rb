I did  intern and became the accountant for a Non-for-Profit Organization with the money I saved, I decided to take a shot in owning my own business and move to Orlando where I co-own a restaurant/lounge. It was an amazing experience but did not feel happy with encouragement of my parents I decided to chase my dreams and join the tech field and learn to code. I found Actualize , it made coding less intimidating, and taught us how learn our own."
